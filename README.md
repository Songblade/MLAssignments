# MLAssignments
This repository contains the projects I made during my Machine Learning course. Note that since the professor worked at Google, projects were originally done in Google Docs and Google Colab. I moved them here afterwards.

Requirements were originally given as the final slide in lecture slide decks, but I moved them to their own document so you could view them.
