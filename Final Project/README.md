# Recommender System Project

This is a project where I create a recommender system. Using the Movielens dataset, with ratings on a 1-5 scale from well over a thousand movies and nearly a thousand users.
The project is written in Python using the TensorFlow Keras library.
It involved creating a simple model using collaborative filtering along with a hybrid model that used a neural network to also incorporate genre information.

My code and results can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/Songblade/MLAssignments/blob/main/Final%20Project/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb).
[This file](https://github.com/Songblade/MLAssignments/blob/main/Final%20Project/2024%20-%20Recommender%20System%20ML%20Final%20Project%20Specification.pdf) contains the project's instructions, while [this one](https://github.com/Songblade/MLAssignments/blob/main/Final%20Project/ML%20Final%20Project.pdf) contains the writeup for the project
